Part A 

What i find for there are several questions which we need to check in my perspective are really important

 Notepad does not support having multiple people working on the same file at the same time. Updates are not transferred automatically between computers.so we need to ask this

  When you open a file ending with the .bat extension, it does not save edits unless you choose Save As.

  We need to check that we no need to keep working on multiple windos at one time 

  
Windows 11's Notepad has a new feature that automatically saves your session state so we need to check it.
