#Formulas Not Calculating

A. I did a research on it why its showing the formula instead of answer and i find 


we need to check there is no space before the formula

 we need to check the cell is not formatted as Text. If there is  then press F2 and press Enter without changing anything.
 
 we need to check the commas you should use semicolons instead of commas in the formula
 
Make sure that the cell is not formatted as Text.

 we need to check Calculation Option and ensure it's set to Automatic.
